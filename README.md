🚀 What is Micro-Fuzzer?Micro-Fuzzer is a high-performance specialized logic engine built for automated source code sanitization. In a landscape where code quality is non-negotiable, this tool acts as a "Syntax Firewall," utilizing a strict deterministic framework to ensure 100% predictable outcomes without the "hallucinations" common in modern AI models.🛠️ The Core MissionMicro-Fuzzer focuses on Structural Integrity. It is designed to automatically identify patches for common programming mistakes (missing semicolons, mismatched brackets, malformed keywords) and apply them with zero human intervention.🧠 Deterministic Logic vs. Generative AIWhile Generative AI is a powerful creative partner, Micro-Fuzzer is your Compliance Guardian.Feature🤖 Generative AI (LLMs)🛡️ Micro-Fuzzer (Deterministic)ReliabilityProbabilistic; may suggest incorrect code100% Accuracy; based on strict rulesSpeedHigh latency (API calls/Inference)Sub-millisecond (Instant local execution)PrivacyOften requires cloud connectivity100% Offline; Zero data leaksAuditabilityBlack-box decision makingFull H2 SQL audit logs for forensic reviewSecurityRisk of introducing hidden vulnerabilitiesPrevents bad patterns before they compile⚡ Key Technical Features🔍 Precision Scanning: Advanced regex patterns for real-time anomaly detection.📜 Integrity Logging: Automatically records every modification in an embedded H2 SQL Database to maintain a permanent audit trail.🔒 Zero-Trust Execution: Operates entirely within your local environment; your code never leaves the machine.🎨 Industrial UI: A high-contrast, low-latency interface optimized for professional developer workflows.💎 Significance of the SoftwareAutomated program repair significantly relieves developers from the burden of manual bug-fixing. Micro-Fuzzer addresses the "Last Mile" of development by:Preventing Build Failures: Catching syntax errors that would otherwise break CI/CD pipelines.Enhancing Security: Automating the repair of specific classes of vulnerabilities like malformed inputs or buffer-related syntax.Scaling Quality: Providing a "quality gate" that ensures all code meets a baseline structural standard before further review.📦 Installation & UsagePrerequisitesJava: version 17 or higherMaven: for dependency managementQuick StartBash# Clone the repository
